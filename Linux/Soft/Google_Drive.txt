__Installing from source__

If you are using a different distribution or you want to build the package from source, you may want to use OPAM (an OCaml package manager). If you are on a Debian Jessie, check out these instructions (contributed by Martin Gallant): How to install from source on Debian Jessie.
Installing with OPAM

	__Install OPAM__ (http://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html)

	__Install the C tools and libraries: m4, curl, fuse, and sqlite3. These dependencies are not managed by OPAM, so you have to install them in order to compile the executable. If you are using a .deb based distribution, you can install the libraries with this command:__

	$ sudo apt-get install m4 libcurl4-gnutls-dev libfuse-dev libsqlite3-dev zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev

	__Starting OPAM__
s
	$ opam init

	__Update OPAM__

	$ opam update

	__Install google-drive-ocamlfuse__

	$ opam install google-drive-ocamlfuse

__Monter le disque__
google-drive-ocamlfuse [[/home/jmcollongette/Gdrive]]

__Montage automatique__
